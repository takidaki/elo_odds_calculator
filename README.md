This is a Streamlit-based web application that calculates betting odds (1X2) based on Elo ratings for soccer teams. The app allows users to select a country and league, fetch the teams' Elo ratings, and compute the win probability for both home and away teams, as well as odds for the 1X2 betting market.

Features
Select a country and league to fetch Elo ratings of home and away teams.
Calculate win probabilities based on Elo ratings.
Calculate Draw No Bet odds for both teams.
Choose a draw probability between 0.15 and 0.4 to calculate final 1X2 betting odds.
Clean and user-friendly interface with dynamic dropdowns and interactive sliders.

How it Works
Country and League Selection:

Select a country from the dropdown menu. Once a country is selected, the corresponding leagues will be populated dynamically.
Fetching Team Data:

Once you've selected the country and league, the app fetches the latest team Elo ratings from a website.
Win Probability Calculation:

The win probability for both the home and away teams is calculated using their Elo ratings. 
â€‹
 
Draw No Bet Odds:

Based on the calculated win probabilities, the Draw No Bet odds for both teams are displayed.
1X2 Betting Odds:

You can adjust the draw probability using a slider (between 0.15 and 0.4). Based on the selected draw probability, the app recalculates the 1X2 odds.
User Interface:

The interface provides dynamic dropdowns, showing data relevant to the selected country and league.
A progress spinner will show while the app fetches the data.
